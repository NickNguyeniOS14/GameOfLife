# What is GameOfLife?
- The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a 'cellular automaton', and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.

- This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.

# Rules:

In the Game of Life, these rules examine each cell of the grid. For each cell, it counts that cell's eight neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals), and then act on that result.

- If the cell is alive and has 2 or 3 neighbors, then it remains alive. Else it dies.
- If the cell is dead and has exactly 3 neighbors, then it comes to life. Else if remains dead.
